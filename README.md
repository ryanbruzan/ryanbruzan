<h2>:man_technologist: &nbsp; Hi there, I'm Ryan.</h2>
<p>I'm an experienced developer building neat stuff with awesome people.  Most of my stuff is private, but in my free time I build robust, reusable tools and plugins that are free for all.  Forks are always welcome!</p>
<p>:fire: &nbsp; <strong>I’m currently working on</strong> a future chore-sharing app to help you get stuff done.  <a href="https://www.trychap.com">Check it out &rarr;</a></p>
<p>:computer: &nbsp; <strong>I’m currently learning</strong> Vue.js and how to effectively implement it into new projects in the future.</p>
